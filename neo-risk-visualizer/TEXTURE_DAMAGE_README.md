# Texture Damage Analysis Feature

## Overview

The Texture Damage Analysis feature adds comprehensive material vulnerability calculations to the asteroid impact simulation system. This feature analyzes how different materials and textures respond to blast pressure and thermal radiation, providing detailed insights into structural vulnerabilities and human impact consequences.

## Features

### üß¨ Material Damage Calculations
- **8 Material Types**: Glass, wood, concrete, steel, brick, asphalt, vegetation, and fabric
- **Dual-Factor Analysis**: Combines blast pressure and thermal flux effects
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides confidence intervals (P5, P50, P95) for all calculations
- **Physics-Based**: Uses scientifically-grounded damage thresholds

### üí• Damage Mechanisms
- **Blast Pressure Effects**: Material failure under overpressure
- **Thermal Radiation**: Heat-induced damage and ignition
- **Combined Effects**: Takes maximum of thermal and blast damage radii
- **Angle Correction**: Accounts for grazing vs. vertical impacts

### ü©∏ Flesh & Consequences Schema
Each material includes detailed consequence analysis:
- **Glass**: Projectile hazards causing lacerations and eye injuries
- **Concrete/Steel**: Structural collapse leading to crushing trauma
- **Wood**: Splinter injuries and blunt force trauma
- **Fabric**: Thermal burns and exposure-related injuries

## Implementation

### Backend (Python)

#### New Models
```python
class TextureEffect(BaseModel):
    material_type: str
    damage_threshold: float
    damage_percentage: UncertaintyBand
    r_km: UncertaintyBand
    description: str
    consequences: str
```

#### Physics Calculations
Located in `backend/physics/impact_effects.py`:
- Material-specific pressure thresholds (0.05 - 5.0 PSI)
- Thermal flux thresholds (30,000 - 300,000 J/m¬≤)
- Combined radius calculations with angle corrections
- Damage percentage based on distance from impact

#### API Integration
- Extended `/simulate` endpoint to include texture effects
- Added to simulation response under `effects.texture`
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing clients

### Frontend (React)

#### UI Components
- **DamageSummary Component**: Displays texture damage in collapsible section
- **Material Cards**: Individual cards showing damage percentage and consequences
- **Consequences Schema**: Background information panel explaining flesh effects

#### Visual Features
- Material-specific icons (ü™ü glass, üèóÔ∏è concrete, etc.)
- Color-coded damage percentages
- Expandable consequences descriptions
- Responsive grid layout
