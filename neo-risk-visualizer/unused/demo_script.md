# Impactor-2025 Demo Script
**2-3 Minute NASA Space Apps Challenge Demo**

## Opening Hook (15 seconds)
*[Show title screen/logo]*

**"On February 15, 2013, a 20-meter asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, injuring over 1,500 people. What if it had been bigger? What if we saw it coming? Today, we present Impactor-2025 - an interactive tool for asteroid impact assessment and planetary defense planning."**

## Problem & Solution (20 seconds)
*[Show news clips/images of asteroid impacts]*

**"Current asteroid risk assessment tools are complex, technical, and inaccessible to decision-makers and the public. Impactor-2025 bridges this gap by providing:**
- **Real-time impact simulations with uncertainty quantification**
- **Clear risk communication, not just raw numbers**
- **Interactive mitigation scenario planning**

## Live Demo (90 seconds)

### Impact Simulation (45 seconds)
*[Screen recording: Open application]*

**"Let me show you how it works. Here's our interactive map interface."**

*[Click on New York City]*
**"I'll select New York as our impact location - not because we want this to happen, but because urban impacts have the highest consequences."**

*[Adjust parameters]*
**"Now I'll set our asteroid parameters. Let's use a 140-meter asteroid - NASA's threshold for a 'city-killer' - traveling at 25 km/s."**

*[Click Simulate]*
**"When I hit simulate, our physics engine calculates blast effects, thermal radiation, and crater formation using simplified Earth Impact Effects Program formulas."**

*[Show results appearing]*
**"Within 2 seconds, we see the results. The blast effects extend up to 15 kilometers, thermal effects reach 8 kilometers, and we estimate 2.3 million people potentially affected - with uncertainty bands showing the range from 1.8 to 3.1 million."**

*[Highlight uncertainty visualization]*
**"Notice how we communicate uncertainty with these probability bands - this isn't science fiction, it's rigorous risk assessment."**

### Mitigation Scenario (45 seconds)
*[Switch to Mitigation tab]*

**"But here's the real power - what can we do about it? Let's explore deflection missions."**

*[Select Kinetic Impactor method]*
**"I'll select a kinetic impactor mission - like NASA's successful DART mission that just proved this works."**

*[Adjust parameters]*
**"With a 100 cm/s velocity change and 10 years lead time..."**

*[Run simulation]*
**"Our model shows this mission would shift the impact corridor by 8,000 kilometers - turning a direct hit into a complete miss, potentially saving 2.3 million lives."**

*[Show comparison view]*
**"The before-and-after comparison makes the value crystal clear - a $500 million mission saves millions of lives and trillions in damage."**

## Technical Innovation (20 seconds)
*[Show architecture diagram briefly]*

**"Under the hood, Impactor-2025 integrates:**
- **Real NASA CNEOS asteroid data**
- **Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation**  
- **USGS population exposure analysis**
- **Simplified but scientifically-grounded physics**

**All delivered through a responsive web interface that works on any device."**

## Impact & Future (15 seconds)
*[Show team slide or future vision]*

**"This tool democratizes planetary defense planning. Emergency managers can assess regional risks. Policy makers can evaluate mission investments. The public can understand why asteroid detection and deflection matter."**

**"We built this in 3 days for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, but the vision is bigger - making space hazard assessment as accessible as weather forecasting."**

## Call to Action (10 seconds)
*[Show final slide with links]*

**"Try Impactor-2025 yourself at [demo-url]. Explore different scenarios. See how small deflections early can prevent global catastrophes. Because when it comes to asteroids, an ounce of prevention is worth... well, saving civilization."**

**"Thank you!"**

## Demo Backup Talking Points

### If Technical Issues:
- "While we resolve this technical issue, let me explain what you would see..."
- Have screenshots ready as backup slides
- Emphasize the physics and methodology

### Key Messages to Emphasize:
- **Uncertainty is communicated, not hidden**
- **Early deflection is exponentially more effective**
- **Real NASA data powers realistic scenarios**  
- **Public engagement drives political support for planetary defense**

### Questions & Answers:
**Q: How accurate is the physics?**
A: "We use simplified Earth Impact Effects Program equations - accurate enough for risk assessment and decision-making, simplified enough for real-time calculation. Production systems would integrate full atmospheric models and geological surveys."

**Q: What about false alarms?**
A: "Our uncertainty quantification helps distinguish between probable impacts and statistical noise. Real missions would only launch after extensive observation campaigns confirm the threat."

**Q: Cost estimates realistic?**  
A: "Based on actual missions like DART ($330M) and proposed gravity tractor concepts. Expensive compared to most space missions, but incredibly cheap compared to impact damage."

## Technical Demo Checklist

### Before Recording:
- [ ] Test all scenarios work smoothly
- [ ] Ensure fast API responses (pre-populate cache)
- [ ] Check map renders properly
- [ ] Verify uncertainty bands display correctly
- [ ] Test mitigation comparisons

### During Demo:
- [ ] Keep cursor movements smooth and deliberate
- [ ] Pause after each major result appears
- [ ] Highlight uncertainty ranges explicitly
- [ ] Show the dramatic before/after comparison
- [ ] Keep energy high and focused

### Backup Plans:
- [ ] Screenshots of key results ready
- [ ] Local fallback if API fails
- [ ] Clear explanation of what should happen
- [ ] Pivot to problem statement if demo breaks
